# Parallel_Computing

For the course Parallel Computing of the Master's course of Software Engineering at Universidade do Minho, we worked on this three part assignment. 

In the first part, we developed a sequential code for the algorithm *K-means* and analised our implementation. We implemented a parallel version using OpenMP for the second part. For the last part, we tried to improve our implementation after analysing the previous part. We also implemented a parallel code using CUDA.
